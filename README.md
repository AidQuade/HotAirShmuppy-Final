# Shmup Project

Take to the skies in your trusty hot air balloon! Fight off the balloon pirates in this steampunkesque shoot em up project. This is my first real game project for the ATLAS class "Game Development". Arrow keys to control hot air balloon, mouse to aim and shoot. You have a chance to patch up the damage to your balloon if you hit "X" while falling from the sky. Some physics simulation of the balloon basket means your shots will be more accurate the less youre swinging around.
